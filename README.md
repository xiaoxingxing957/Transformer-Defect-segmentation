# Transformer-Defect-segmentation
#This project aims to achieve pixel-level defect segmentation, primarily employing a spatio-temporal feature extraction method based on TSR.
#For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the paper:Automated defect detection using spatial and temporal deep learning in thermographic nondestructive evaluation.
