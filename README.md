<H1>Transformer-based Defect Segmentation.</H1><br>
introduction:This paper proposes a defect segmentation framework based on TSR derivative spatio-temporal signals and the Transformer model. The framework effectively combines the advantages of TSR derivative signals with the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer, thereby significantly enhancing the model’s capability for defect detection and edge segmentation. The framework first performs first-order derivative TSR processing to suppress noise and enhance defect contrast in infrared thermal image sequence. Next, the optimal sampling location and image sequence length are determined based on the sampling strategy. Subsequently, spatio-temporal samples for each pixel are extracted using a feature extraction method. Finally, a Transformer-based defect segmentation model effectively learns representative defect features from these spatio-temporal samples. The binary segmentation images generated by the model accurately identify defect shapes and regions.<br>
